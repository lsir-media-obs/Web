								<h3 class="underlined">THE PROBLEM</h3>
								<p>The digitalization and globalization of our news channels had a profound impact on worldwide information diffusion. Today, information is processed in mass by large organizational structures, before being propagated to downstream channels. This process often obfuscates the origin of a news and reduces its traceability. More worryingly, large broadcasting groups have recently been suspected of massive consolidation of resources, a that usually translates into an unilateral selection of news event broadcasted in multiple channels.

								This worrying lack of diversity has recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc">been exposed by John Oliver</a> in his show <i>Last Week Tonight</i> (HBO). Soon after, a video exemplifying the problem was posted online. 

								<iframe width="728" height="410" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWLjYJ4BzvI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<!--This phenomenon has an impact on what is called the <a href="https://www.mediamonitor.nl/english/the-concept-of-pluralism-media-diversity/">external pluralism</a> assumption: theoretically, a large number of news channels should be available to ensure a variety of viewpoints, but the suggested rising concentration of media ownership may void this assumption. This observation motivates the study of the impact of ownership on the global media landscape and its influence on the coverage the actual viewer receives.

								<br /><br />-->

								We developped an algorithm to automate the tracking and the monitoring of broadcasted news content. Our method evaluates the similarity across news entities and projects each of the considered channel on a comprehensive map, as show in <a>see Fig.1</a>.

								Since the structure arises directly from the coverage we can extract factors of the bias, such as geographic relationships, thematic regards or higher-order structures, despite them not always being evident to the inexperienced eye. One notable example is the presence of small, local broadcast affiliates, usually household names (e.g. Fox or ABC).
						
								However, many of these outlets are actually owned by larger corporate structures, some of which, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc" target="_blank">most infamously Sinclair Broadcast Group</a>, have been accused of imposing ideologically charged content on these downstream channels, unbeknownst to the casual viewer.

								<br /><br />

								Our method borrows from the field of personalization with a set of techniques commonly used in recommender systems, such as those used on Amazon or Netflix. In particular, the algorithm predicts the probability of a channel to cover a specific event, knowing which other sources have selected it. To this extent, the algorithm learns a fingerprints of the sources' coverage patterns. We can then compare these coverage profiles to uncover similarities in the choice of their reporting, usually indicating the presence of a common bias.

								<h3 class="underlined">THE EVOLUTION OVER TIME</h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/evolution.png" alt="">
								<p>
									The selection of reported events can generate a comprehensive map of the the news ecosystem. However, the methods only provide a static view into this inherently dynamic system. In order to circumvent this limitation, we developped an additional technique that models the evolution of this ecosystem. The static snapshop becomes an evolving map, that highlight the main tendencies.

									We demonstrate the potential of the method for news monitoring applications and investigative journalism by shedding light on important changes in programming induced by mergers and acquisitions, policy changes, or network-wide content diffusion. An example of the phenomenon is show <a>in Fig.2</a>: news sources tend to agglomerate themselves in cohesive clusters after their acquisition by 3 well-known news companies, clearly showing the consolidation of resources taking place.

								<h3 class="underlined">DETECTING HIGHLY INFLUENCIAL BROADCAST GROUPS</h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/concentration.jpg" alt="">
								<p>
									One of the most common observable pattern is the content alignement of a group of sources in a specific position. On the map, the phenomenon is represented as a group of sources converging toward the same position. We propose an automated method to detect this pattern by introducing the notion of <b>attractors</b>: the algorithm identifies regions of the map toward which many sources tend to move. The region with high potential of attration are show in blue in <a>Fig.3</a>.
