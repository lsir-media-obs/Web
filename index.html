								<p>
									We are researchers from EPFL, fighting for media accountability and information democracy. Because the independence of news
									channels acquired by large broadcasting groups has recently been questioned, we are working to create an exhaustive map of the
									digital media ecosystem. In short,
								</p>

								<div id="top-insights">
								<ul>
									<li> We propose a model of the media landscape that automatically maps news sources based on their coverage.</li>
									<li> By tracking sources' evolution over time, we identify driving forces, from the influence of ownership to large-scale content diffusion patterns.</li>
									<li> We produce a dynamic map of the media landscape over the last 3 years, based on coverage from 500M articles shared by around 8K sources.</li>
								</ul>

								</div>
								We plan to release an open and interactive map based on these insights, which can be used by anyone, from viewers to journalists, to dig into patterns that influence the media ecosystem. <a href="#contact">Subscribe to our newsletter to stay tuned!</a>

								<h3 class="underlined">THE PROBLEM</h3>
								<p>The digitalization and globalization of our news channels have had a profound impact on worldwide information diffusion. Nowadays, information
									is processed in mass by large organizational structures, before being propagated to local channels.
									This process often obfuscates the origin of a news story, blurs the accountability chain to the author of its coverage,
									and reduces the traceability to its inception.

									<br /><br />

									Large broadcasting groups have recently been suspected of massive consolidation of resources, pooling resources to reduce the cost of producing stories.
									Unfortunately, this reduces the diversity of coverage that reaches the viewer, with multiple local channels sharing the same
									selection of news, pruned by actors often unbeknownst to them.

								The lack of diversity and accountability can be worrisome, particularly when this content is ideologically charged, as has recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc">been exposed by John Oliver</a> in his show <i>Last Week Tonight</i> (HBO). This surreal footage shows journalists all reading the same scripted text, provided by Sinclair Broadcasting Group, a large conglomerate of local sources, about ... the lack of diversity in the news.

								<iframe width="728" height="410" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWLjYJ4BzvI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<!--This phenomenon has an impact on what is called the <a href="https://www.mediamonitor.nl/english/the-concept-of-pluralism-media-diversity/">external pluralism</a> assumption: theoretically, a large number of news channels should be available to ensure a variety of viewpoints, but the suggested rising concentration of media ownership may void this assumption. This observation motivates the study of the impact of ownership on the global media landscape and its influence on the coverage the actual viewer receives.

								<br /><br />-->

								In our work, we proposed an algorithm to automate the tracking and the monitoring of broadcasted news content.
								One of the main difficulties in the development of such a method is the absence of ground truth:
								any selection of events is partial by nature and is only comparable to the selection made by other channels.

								Therefore, our method compares the coverage of events <i>across</i> news entities. This produces a similarity map, where distances
								between channels represent the similarity of their coverage. An example map is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.

								<br /><br />

								The map reveals a structure that is directly derived from coverage. This means we can identify common patterns in sources' coverage after the fact, i.e. without any assumptions on
								what they may be. In other words, we do not bias the search for biases.

								Through analysis, we uncovered topical factors such as sources' geographic relationships - local sources cover similar events - or thematic regards.
								Interestingly, we also reveal the influence of higher-order broadcast structures, evidence for the influence of large corporate actors in local news.


								Isolating these patterns is far from obvious, particularly given that a source's branding does not always reveal its affiliation: large broadcast entities
								like Sinclair own franchised outlets, often household names like Fox or ABC. Our method provides transparency to the viewer, going beyond surface branding to
								reinstate accountability towards the true origin of the broadcast content.

								<!-- However, many of these outlets are actually owned by larger corporate structures, some of which, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc" target="_blank">most infamously Sinclair Broadcast Group</a>, have been accused of imposing ideologically charged content on these downstream channels, unbeknownst to the casual viewer. -->

								<br /><br />

								Technically speaking, our method borrows from the field of personalization with a set of techniques commonly used in recommender systems,
								such as those used on Amazon or Netflix. The intuition is that we can model a source's selection of covered news as a preference problem:
								the editor <i>selects</i> or chooses the events that are most relevant to their audience.

								As such, the algorithm tries to predict the likelihood of a channel covering a given event. To do so, it observes
								which other sources have selected it, trying to mimic the behavior of sources similar to that which it is trying to model.
								In a sense, the algorithm learns a fingerprint of each sources' coverage patterns so it can match it to other similar ones.
								These coverage profiles can then be compared to uncover similarities in the choice of their reporting,
								usually indicating the presence of a common bias. In sum, sources appearing close together on the map are likely to have a very similar selection of events.

								<h3 class="underlined">An EVOLVING MAP</h3>

									<div class="fig-title">Figure 2: An evolving map of the media landscape.</div>
								</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<br />

								<p>
									We have shown how we can generate a comprehensive map of the news ecosystem from a selection of reported events. However, this first method only
									provides a static view of an inherently dynamic system. As the media landscape is always evolving, we need a more complete model which
									takes into account the dynamics of the news ecosystem. We extend the ideas that provide us with a static snapshot to produce an evolving map of source
									similarity. It highlights
									important changes that occur when channels modify their news coverage habits. The external or internal forces driving this change can also
									be isolated to better understand influences on the media ecosystem.

									<br /><br />

									For example, we demonstrate the method's potential for news monitoring applications and investigative journalism by shedding
									light on important changes in programming induced by mergers and acquisitions, policy changes, or network-wide content
									diffusion. An example of the phenomenon is shown <a href="#fig2">in Figure 2</a>: news sources tend to agglomerate into
									cohesive clusters after their acquisitions by three well-known news companies, clearly showing the consolidation of resources
									taking place in the background and the uniformization of information channels.

									<figcaption>
										<div class="fig-title">Figure 3: Clustering highly influential sources, tracking alignment with the sources they attract.</div>
									</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<br />

								<p>
									One of the most common observable patterns is the convergence of a group of sources towards a specific position: as the similarity of
									their selection of news increases, the model will highlight their increased similarity. We propose an automated method to detect this
									phenomenon by introducing the notion of <i>attractors</i>: the algorithm identifies regions of the map toward which many sources converge.
									Regions with a high potential of attraction are shown in blue in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>.

									<br /><br />

									Once identified, the attracted news sources, which are converging towards an attractor, can be monitored. For example, the acquisition
									campaign performed by Sinclair in September 2017 can be visualized on the right-hand side of <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>. The distance from
									four sources to the attractor is abruptly reduced, suggesting an alignment of content post-acquisition.
